## ISSD Bilişim Elektronik A.Ş. Computer Vision Projects Summer Training Program İnternship - 2019 <br/>
**Proposal :** <br/>
*Topics selected:* <br/> 
• Shape Detection, Recognition <br/>
• OCR <br/>
• Counting <br/>
• Tracking <br/>  

**1. Shape Recognition & Detection** <br/>
**Project #1:** <br/>
*1. Aim of this project:* <br/>
• Introduce basic ideas of loading an image operations, load, convert, color spaces, Morphologicals and kernels <br/>
• Introduce the idea of object detection with different scenarios: <br/>
• Real world image <br/>
*2. Scenario:* <br/>
• Generate shapes at random areas of the scene <br/>
• Overlay and highlight objects in scene for user feedback <br/>
• Sort out the objects which one is closes to the left edge <br/>
**• Project #2:** <br/>
*1. Aim of this project:* <br/>
• Apply what was learned in project 1 to detect an object in real world ( vehicle
in our context )
• Introduce the idea of features ( corners, edges ) <br/>
• Introduce the idea of templates <br/>
*2. Scenario:* <br/>
• Detect a car in the scene <br/>
• Locate car plate in the scene, highlight it <br/>

**2. OCR** <br/>
**Project #1:** <br/>
*1. Aim of this project:* <br/>
• Introduce character recognition problems <br/>
• Introduce the concept of machine learning in vision <br/>
*2. Scenario:* <br/>
• Using ready package to read a character from ideal image, then real world <br/>
• Building a Machine Learning Model read a character from ideal image, then real world <br/>
• Develop tactics to read a sentence, plate <br/>

**3. Counting** <br/>
**Project #1:** <br/>
*1. Aim of this project:* <br/>
▪ Introduce vehicle counting problem <br/>
*2. Scenario* <br/>
•Having videos in hand, count the vehicles passing in a specific direction at specific time <br/>

**4. Tracking** <br/>
**Project #1 :** <br/>
*1. Aim of this project:* <br/>
• Introduce deeplearning concepts and Single shot detectors <br/>
• Introduce motion detection concepts <br/> 
• Introduce the need to track objects in the scene <br/>
*2. Scenario:* <br/>
• Using a trained model detect vehicles in the scene, every N seconds <br/>
• Highlight the object if its the same object detected at t and t-n seconds ( Centroid,Kalman, ... ) <br/>
